## Challenge Overview

This challenge offered the user no starter code to begin. The user created a unique repository that exhibited the challenge. The user then created index.html, style.css, README.md, and an image folder. The user constructed a portfolio that displays their background, work samples, and contact information. The user then created the structure of the application via html so that when viewed, the application displays an image of the employee, efficient navigation, and links to the displayed work. To make the application look and operate effectively, the user utilized advanced CSS styles such as media queries, flexbox layouts, responsive design, and selectors.
